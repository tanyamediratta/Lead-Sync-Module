# Lead Sync Module

This project is a **full-stack lead management module** designed to demonstrate how marketing leads from multiple ad platforms can be integrated into a single CRM system.  
It automatically **fetches leads from mock Meta and Google Ads APIs**, ensures **deduplication** at the database level, and provides a clean **React dashboard** to monitor both **leads** and **sync logs**.  

The project simulates a real-world scenario where companies run ads on multiple platforms and need to consolidate data into one reliable system.
