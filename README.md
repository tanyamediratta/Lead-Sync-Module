Lead Sync Module

This project is a full-stack lead management module designed to demonstrate how marketing leads from multiple ad platforms can be integrated into a single CRM system.

It automatically fetches leads from mock Meta and Google Ads APIs, ensures deduplication at the database level, and provides a clean React dashboard to monitor both leads and sync logs.

The project simulates a real-world scenario where companies run ads on multiple platforms and need to consolidate data into one reliable system.
